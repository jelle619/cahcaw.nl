# Map

I'm as free as a bird, yet I can't fly. So, the best I can do, is climb in a tree.

This is my map, of all the tree I found which are climable. I hold it very dear because there aren't many trees which are climable, and this helps me keep track of what is where.

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; max-width: 854px; height: calc(100vh * 0.8); max-height: 480px;" src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1rexbN4E9FwTg3A7drjZBdTnQAMmkUco&ehbc=2E312F" width="854" height="480"></iframe>

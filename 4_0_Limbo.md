# 4.0 Limbo

## 27.11.23

2 months have passed, and the 2 months have passed which they said they needed to give us a response.

---

## 19.4.23

Half a year passed, and the silence was finally broken by the inheritor. Mike got a message from the contact person:

*Hey Mike, haven't heard anything in a while. I may assume that in the spring the cleanup will happen as wished by me to not be in conflict with the municipality. Yours kindly, ███*

Strange? We didn't hear anything from the municipality in the end.

Our response:

*Dear ███
It's true you haven't heard anything of us in a while, that is because we haven't heard anything new. The municipality has told us that until we have a formal response on our request there is no conflict. We would like to wait until this response before we take further action. Of course we will make sure that until this time comes we keep the area around the treehouse clean. Of course if we get positive news, which they said is possible, we will buy the plot of land.
Yours kindly,
Mike*

Rather quickly he gave an answer:
*Thanks for the response, make sure the land stays clean and doesn't invite illegal dumping of trash ... We shall patiently wait for the response of the municipality ... bye and have a nice day yours kindly ███"*

...

and the silence continued.

## 27.4.23

Whilst working on these pages and going through all the chat logs I realized I had never thanked the editorial. So, I wrote them a message:

*I actually never told you that thanks to you the treehouse is still standing, or did I?
Either way, I want to thank you a lot.
We are currently waiting for the 5-7 business day respond from the municipality regarding the definitive verdict, after they realized it is typical procedure that they first have to approve/disapprove of the exoneration request before they can force us to go away*

His response:
*"Hey Filip,
Thanks for the message, and you're welcome.
No, I did not know this.
I did sometimes think about how things are going now.
Maybe good to come back to it, next week.
Yours kindly,
███"*

Me:
*"Mwah, is it okay if we come back to it once the final verdict has been made?
We don't want to wake up sleeping wolves"*

Him:
*Understandable.
That wouldn't be good...*

Me:
*Either way, thank you for everything! You will one day hear from me.*

Him:
*No problem, hope you can stay.*


...

and the silence continued.

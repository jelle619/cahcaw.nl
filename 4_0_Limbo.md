## 27.11.23

2 months have passed, and the 2 months have passed which they said they needed to give us a response.

## 19.4.23

Half a year passed, and the silence was finally broken by the inheritor. Mike got a message from the contact person who started talking about a cleanup again. 
He was worried about them making a commition again.
This was strange, we didn't hear anything from the municipality. We wondered... but most certainly were not going to give in.
So we sent him a message reminding him that there was nothing going on, and how we were going to buy the plot of land if we got approval from the municipality.
Then he said thanks, reminded us of preventing illegal dumping of trash, and told us to have a nice day.

...

and the silence continued.

## 27.4.23

Whilst working on these pages and going through all the chat logs I realized I had never thanked the editorial. So, I wrote them a message:

*I actually never told you that thanks to you the treehouse is still standing, or did I?
Either way, I want to thank you a lot.
We are currently waiting for the 5-7 business day respond from the municipality regarding the definitive verdict, after they realized it is typical procedure that they first have to approve/disapprove of the exoneration request before they can force us to go away*

His response:
*"Hey Filip,
Thanks for the message, and you're welcome.
No, I did not know this.
I did sometimes think about how things are going now.
Maybe good to come back to it, next week.
Yours kindly,
███"*

Me:
*"Mwah, is it okay if we come back to it once the final verdict has been made?
We don't want to wake up sleeping wolves"*

Him:
*Understandable.
That wouldn't be good...*

Me:
*Either way, thank you for everything! You will one day hear from me.*

Him:
*No problem, hope you can stay.*


...

and the silence continued.

# Request
Hey there scaly administrator. Here is an overview of the things I still would like fixed:

- have the ability for an image to make a sound when it is pressed (one-time,  so weird workarounds are fine)
- titles/headers are a bit weird... It is currently the case that when I have a header, the header pops up twice (I guess once for the title, one for the header, which are always the same). I removed some headers for now because it looks better, but I don't think it should be that way?
- dragone easter egg, somewhere? Idk

# Home
Cahcaw etymology: A screech used to immitate a crow.
Why? That is for you to figure out.
This site is still work in progress, and will be used to host content held dear to the crows and all their madness.

## Navigation
To navigate the website, look on the sidebar to the left. This sidebar contains all available pages. On mobile this sidebar can be navigated by pressing the blue icon on the bottom left corner.

## Summary
Here follows a small summary of all the content that can be found on this site.
- Treehouse Story
The most epic story to have ever taken place in Vaesrade in living memory - the story of the treehouse. Whenever I tell people about it they say I should make a movie of it. Sadly don't have the budget to do that, so the best I can do is host a domain for â‚¬5/year ....
- Commune
The treehouse made us realize how enjoyable building things is. Thus, the future of the crows lays in buying a plot of land and starting a commune on it. Since this is all still a far-fetched ambition, it will host all plans and intel we have on this topic.
- Crow Zone
Purely dedicated to crows
- Extra
Other things I've been up to in life which are crow-themed

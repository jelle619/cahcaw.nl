# 3.4 Editorial

## 16.09.22

The 5 workdays have passed. It was time to escalate. I had already prepared my text at this point, and knew where to upload the editorial tip. My text was as follows:

*Dear editorial,*

*Hereby I want to share my story (and frustrations) about quite a unique situation. This story starts in Oktober 2020, when the second lockdown had just started and there wasn't a whole lot to do. So, me (Filip, at time 18) and a friend of mine (Mike, at the time 19) came up with the idea to build a treehouse. The beautiful thing about this, is that it gave us a reason to go outside, which was in short supply because covid was on the rise. Mike had as a young-teen always wanted to build a treehouse, but wasn ever able to fulfill this wish of his. He had in fact had cancer 5 years earlier, and left him chronically fatigued. Since we didn't have a tree available in our backyard, we decided to build it in a tree in a seemingly abandoned forest.*

*This has lead to positive consequencies. It helped us to keep busy during the lockdowns, but it also significantly improved Mike's chronic fatigue. This is because we built the entire treehouse by hand (no electronic tools), which meant we were constantly in motion. This became even more obvious when at one of the medical checkups he was told he had improved. The doctors were legitimately impressed. On top of that, this upwards trend was true for every consecutive checkup. It is currently the case that compared to others with a similar illness, he seems to be a lot less impacted than most. It is also the case that it has played a big role in coming on top of my depression. It so badly impeding me, in combination with a fear of failure, that it is the primary reason I failed my studies after high school. For a long time I considered suicide and I felt useless. The treehouse brought about a change in my world, because it gave meaning. It kept me from my thoughts of ending my life, because it gave me something in my life to care about. The logic is that I mustn't end my life now, because then no more progress will be made on the treehouse. It acted like an occupational therapy, whereby I was a lot less busy with my thoughts because I could endlessly work on this one thing.*

*Us saying we have sentimental value to the treehouse, is an understatement. Because the treehouse was one of the tree, we cared a lot about the tree itself too. We always found it important to keep the area around the tree clean (even the smallest pieces of plastic). We also thought it to be important to keep the amount of branches lost to an absolute minimum, to reduce our influence on the growth of the tree. We had even bought fertilizer to keep the health of the tree up to par. We most certainly felt a strong connection with the tree. Without a healthy tree, the treehouse would not be. The ecosystems around us also agree with how awesome the treehouse is. We have had ant nests, we have had mouses using our hut as a shelter, we even once found a bird nest. We put this bird nest under quarantine (so we wouldn't bother it). In the meantime the birds already got big and have flown away.*

*Since the terrain we found ourselves on was abandoned, we stayed undisturbed for one and a half year. Eventually three rangers came along, which filed a police report. This had the consequence of the law enforcement making a visit to our treehouse. The law enforcement was impressed by the creative idea, whereby one even said he would do it too. Not only that, but they complimented us of how sturdy the treehouse is. But, since it's all still technically illegal, they ordered us to stop building. They also mandated us to figure out the owners of the land and encouraged us to make the treehouse legal.*

*We kept firmly to the order to stop building. We also searched for the original owner. After some research we figured out that the land was bought in 1954 by a brother and sister. They have since then both died, leaving 4 heirs each. Meaning in total there are 8 heiers, who all have a say. The amount of heiers, who don't have contact with one another anymore, has thus made it so the land has been abandoned. After we got into touch with these heiers, the first one we found started taking initiative to help us on the search. Since they didn't have any use for the land itself, all 8 agreed to sell us the land. We even got to the point where we made an offer, and they made a reasonable counteroffer. We had put out a whole plan on how to finance it, whereby we cool pool together the capital with 5 people to become collective owners of the land.*

*The only other problem to solve is the agreement with the* bouwplan. *This was sadly not the case. After some research we found out that it has been designated 2 bouwplannen. The 1st one is* 'agrarisch met waarden - natuur- en landschapswaarden', *whereby you're only allowed to build if you keep the nature in mind, with some height restrictions on top of that. Since the treehouse doesn't have a 'purpose' (think about how a company exploits the ground), the treehouse is already not allowed to be there. On top of that you're not allowed to build higher than 3 meters. The treehouse itself is 2.5 meters high, but since it has been built at a height of 2m, it is again at conflict.
The 2nd designation is* 'waarde archeologie'. *This* bouwplan *prevents you from doing a single thing on the terrain. This* bouwplan *is strange since that which this* bouwplan *is normally used for, does not allign with the abandoned overgrown and empty terrain. The description reads as follows: "The conservation and protection of archeological monuments and archeological findings, the protection of possible archeological worths within areas with an archeological expectation value.
It is also the case that this is all targeted at protection the ground, which again, the treehouse does not infringe on because it is fully above the ground.*

*This conflict with the* bouwplan, *is eventually that which lead to a 2nd visit of the law enforcement. Hereby, they gave us the order on the 7th of september that the treehouse has to be gone before the 1st of november. This has brought dark clouds to everyone who has ever seen the treehouse, but especially to me and Mike. We poured our heart and soul into it. We have never bothered anyone, and we didn't even bother the nature. Despite our best intentions, it still has to go. Better yet, we think removing the treehouse would have a negative influence on the tree. Because the treehouse is so big, we would inflict harm on the tree by removing everything.*

*What we are currently searching for desperately, is someone within the municipality who could help us. Someone who can help us get a some kind of* ontheffing. *We already had gotten into contact with municipality Beekdaelen, but the person I got into contact with, didn't seem interested to help us. Suffice to say, we are willing to do everything to save the treehouse.*

*But, we don't exactly have a lot of hope. I find this all confirming the following saying: "The criminals get away with everything, and the good peope are punished".*

*Do you know someone who might help us, or are you someone who can mean something to us? Contact (whatsapp or call):
Filip: +31 6 ██████*

*Yours kindly,
Filip, Mike, and all our friends who care about the treehouse.*

*P.S We already tried talking with the municiaplity, but from the looks of it, we are stuck in a corner.*

I received the following e-mail later that day:
Good afternoon,
Thanks for sending in the tip about the treehouse.
From the message I cannot make out where the treehouse is.
Can you let me know?
I am after all reporting in municipality *Beekdaelen* and the *Westelijke Mijnstreek*.
If this treehouse is in this area, I can come by monday and make pictures.
Else I can ask a colleague
Thanks in advance for the response.
Yours kindly,
███

I sent the message back:
Me:
*Hey, I'm the one from the treehouse. I'm glad to hear back from you! The treehouse itself is a bit hidden, but if you come to ██████, then we can walk together to the treehouse ███████.
Me and Mike have both time on monday, but only after 7pm. I am also planning on visiting the municipality building, to ask once again if something can be done for us.*

Editorial guy:
*Thanks for the response.
This is in Vaesrade, correct?
I will be there around 7pm, but I do not have much time because I have to be in Sittard around 8pm.
Friendly regards and until monday.*

Me:
*It is indeed in Vaesrade. You can also come at 6, so we're less short on time.*

Editorial guy:
*Sounds good. Is it okay if we take pictures?*

Me:
*Of course*

## 19.09.22

Just because we were having success with the editorial, didn't mean I was going to sit and wait still in the hopes that it would work. I wanted to continue getting leverage from different angles.

My next plan was the fact that at some point someone mentioned something about a 'police dossier'. I only knew it existed, and I thought to myself that it might be of value to gain insights in it.

It can't hurt to ask, and to make my bid more serious I went to the actual municipality building to ask for it.

I once again didn't get much further than the receptionist, which left my number at yet another person I had never heard of.

---

Later that day I met up with Mike and the editorial at 7pm.
We were greeted by a single man who had a camera with him. Together we walked from his car to the treehouse. There was some conversation going on, but it was nothing too specific. He did mention a 2nd man would be coming - which would have some questions prepared for us and conduct a small interview.
Once we arrived, the man sadly didn't dare to climb into the treehouse. He was however interested in taking pictures of us with the treehouse.
Eventually the 2nd man arrives. He did dare to climb into the treehouse, and was able to admire all the beauty that is within. We sat down for a little bit, and as promised the man asked us some questions. I sadly don't recall the exact questions, but I do remember Mike curating answers which put us in a piteous light.
After not more than an hour we walked back. They were most definitely impressed by our construction. Right before the end, they asked us if they could verify the story at the owners of the plot of the land. That's when I realized I should've asked that beforehand...
When Mike got home, his dad was also (rightfully) disapproving of what we, or rather I, had just done. He too said I really should've gone to the owners first.

....

His response: ABSOLUTELY NOT. He said he did not want a commotion with the municipality about squabbles like these. What was fine though, is to contact the editorial once this is all blown over.

So, I was forced to send the following texts to the editorial:

Me:
*Hello! I have contacted the contact person of the inheritors, and they said they had no interest in publicizing (or now) due to commotion. He did say he was interested in talking once it's all over.
Soo, can you for now drop the idea of contacting the municipality? Then we will pick up contact again at the start of november.*

Editorial guy::
*Okay, but I just need their confirmation that they are okay with you being there.
I don't need their names.
Can you ask them to let me know via e-mail?
Thank you in advance.
Kind regards and good luck.*

Me:
*Then we will do that once the treehouse is gone.
This is because the inheritors have received a lot of backlash because of us, and we don't want even more people giving them a visit...*

Suffice to say... Dead end. Seems like I needed to come up with a new plan. At the same time, there was no more than 2 weeks left before we had to start demolishing the treehouse. Time was running out fast, and so were my options.

I continued brainstorming. My thoughts kept racing from A to B, thinking of more extreme paths. I frequently thought back to the time I thought about chaining myself to the tree. But, in reality, it still didn't seem like a good idea, held back only by the fact it would hinder my future ambitions of the commune.

So I went to bed that night with not much hope. A true miracle would need to happen in order to save our treehouse.

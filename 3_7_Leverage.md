## 24.09.22

What an amazing thing to happen, to just end up on the front page like that. But the truth was, the treehouse still had to go. We of course weren't going to demolish it immediately (as much as the owner urged us to do so), we were just going to take our time. The planning I had was as follows:
1st of November - the treehouse had to be gone.
1st of Oktober - we start demolishing the treehouse
Whereby from the 1st of Oktober till the 2nd we would hold a sleepover party with the crows (since we for some reason had never done that before).

But, life went on per usual. I happened to also visit my friend from Germany that day (the same one who gave the initial idea). Of course this whole news paper article was a big talking point. Since he doesn't know Dutch, I translated the entire article to him.

Whilst translating it, I noticed something I hadn't noticed after initially reading it. This part was tripping me out:
*That being said, Beekdaelen(the municipality) does say to be aware over the situation, and to have an ongoing dialogue with everyone who is involved."*
Ongoing dialogue you say... WHAT DIALOGUE?

Thus far the municipality just came to us with their law enforcers saying x y z. At no point did they have an ongoing dialogue. They only threatened us and borderline harassed the owner. So I thought - what if I just call them up and say to them I demand a dialogue. They oh so clearly said it in the newspaper!

## 26.09.22

First thing monday when I was back from partying in Germany, was calling them up. Time was running out fast and I had to try and use this new-found leverage. I just told the receptionist about the newspaper article, and this problem surrounding dialogue. Almost instantly I noticed how there was this atmosphere of sympathy. She even said that "This is a complicated matter where a lot of people are involved"; as if I had caused something which I couldn't comprehend.

The receptionist told me she was going to see what she can do for me, and how she would drop my number at the guy's office which has shown some sympathy before. She also mentioned how an emergency meeting was happening about this case.


## 27.09.22

As I was about to enter my bus home, I got called up. I knew I had to pick up, but I also just wanted to go home. So, I made the move to have my phone call on a completely filled bus.

On the other side of the line, it was THE guy who had the final say on the matter from the municipality. He seemed a bit sympathetic, but he clearly wasn't trying to get our hopes up either.

He mentioned how he just got back from vacation.
*Kind of hilarious imagining coming back from your vacation and then having to deal with this dumpster fire*
He told us how the municipality wasn't even following their own procedures correctly. The municipality first had to formally process our 'ontheffing' before they could tell us to go. As he described it: "Let's say it got approved, but at the same time the treehouse is already gone. That wouldn't make sense, thus it is typical procedure to first formally process the ontheffing before we can order a demolishment".

Meaning.....
THE DATE OF 1 NOVEMBER WAS NO MORE.

Furthermore he told us that the time window itself was a little tight to begin with. He had only graduated a few years ago, and understood we students have a busy life. Thus he promised, that if we ended up having to demolish the treehouse, he would grant us a more proper time window.

I of course asked him to write me an e-mail about it so I have written proof. I, after all had to calm down a panicked owner of the land. The e-mail I received was as follows:

*Dear sir ███,
as a result of our phone conversation I want to conform a couple of matters. You have made a request to legalise the treehouse. I am the case handler.
During the handling of the request, by all means nothing will be enforced.
This is only possible when a negative recommendation has been given.
For now you don't have to take action until the request has been handled and a formal recommendation has been prompted.
This request are usually handled within 8 weeks, but in principal there is no hard term limit.
Yours kindly,
███

We were safe, but there was one more thing to do - inform our central land owner of this development (the mail I sent is basically a summary, which isn't too interesting). Their response was as follows:

## 30.09.22

*Dear Filip, Mike
The fact stays that ""strangers"", Filip and Mike, which aren't authorized, illegitimately made use of someone else's property, which is forbidden for you!
At the time I permitted the treehouse until summer 2022, after which you had to clean everything up and not enter the property anymore.
However, then you seemed interested to buy this property, until law enforcement messed everything up.
Now it turns out, after havig contact with the municipality, you guys want a postponement and wait for a response from the municipality. Let's say this is in your favor, that means you want to buy the land. Assume that this has been fully worked out on your side.
Is the law enforcement aware that we are in conflict with the end date of 1 november, and all the consequences? We shouldn't use this development to just buy time.
Yours kindly,
███

My response was:
*Dear ███
Of course we are still interested in buying up the plot of land. You must understand though, that we do not want to end in the situation where we buy up the land, only to hear that we have to demolish the treehouse. That is why we are asking you to wait until we have the confidence that it may stay. Last but least, since this(the forwarded mail) is a written confirmation, the law enforcements have been informed too.
Yours kindly,
Filip & Mike*

And that is it right.... What was supposed to be the final day, evaded.... For now.
We never got a response from our contact person on this last mail. He probably out of frustration accepted our plea without feeling like responding.

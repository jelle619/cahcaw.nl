# 3.5 Message

## 22.9.22

I got a mysterious message on facebook messenger (which I never use):
Him:
*"Hey Mike, ███ here from the local broadcast ZO-NWS. Are you the person in the article of the *limburger* which is mentioned in relation with the treehouse?*

"Uhm.... What?" I thought.

Me:
*Of course! Has there been an article publicized about us?*

Him:
*https://www.limburger.nl/cnt/dmf20220922_94325645
If this is you, then yes.
We thought it might be fun to make a tv item if you guys are interested.*

The link redirected us to this:

*Title: Mike beat cancer and Filip his depression by building a treehouse, but now the law enforcement wants to demolish their construction.*
Sadly, the article had a paywall. I did share the news with my friends immediately.

The conversation continued.
Me:
*Sounds fun. One problem though, I explicitly told the *Limburger* to wait with publicizing because the inheritors of the plot of land weren't comfortable with such a publication.*

Him:
*Oooh shit*

Me:
*We, but especially they, were very concerned that the municpality would make an even bigger deal because of it.*

Him:
*Okay. I will drive home. Continue typing but I will respond in about 30 minutes.*

Me:
*I will talk to the others what they think about this. Either way, thanks for the offer!*

Some more back and forth followed, including a call. But, not much really came of it. It boils down to me telling the situation, and him talking about the possibilities & restrictions he has regarding shooting for the local broadcast.

A friend of mine was able to get through the paywall and shared us the article. It went as follows:

The article itself was no different. It was 100% on our side, even giving arguments of why this is ridiculous which we hadn't thought of. Now for the article itself:

*Translation: 
Tag: Law enforcerment
Title: Two friends from Vaesrade have to demolish 'therapeutic' treehouse
Subtitle: A treehouse two adolescents made in Vaesrade has to be demolished again. Causing great sorrow for these friends, who found a lot of support in it.
Author: Geertjan Claessens*

*Once upon a time, there were two friends who were bored to death during covid. This was the case until they found a wonderful tree to build a treehouse in, where, despite all measures, they could chill in.
This is no fable, and the story knows no happy end. When the law enforcement got a hold of the treehouse located in Vaesrade, Mike (21) from Vaesrade and Filip (20) from Hoensbroek have to demolish their construction, because they are in conflict with the rules. The two, according to them, aren't bothering anyone, and would love to stay in the nature. But, like Willem Elsschot had written more than a century ago: 'Between dream and deed, there are laws and practical problems in the way'.*

*Isolation
Which rules the two are breaking is unclear. That being said, Beekdaelen (the municipality) does say to be aware of the situation, and to have an ongoing dialogue with everyone who is involved. In the meantime, the pieces of wood which Mike and Filip want to expand their accommodation with, lay without a purpose in the field under the ginormous tree.
The two students started almost two years ago with their project. The act of building helped them with their isolation. On top of that, they could handle their problems better. Mike struggled, after he had overcome cancer, with chronic fatigue. Filip struggled with performance anxiety and in part thanks to the covid-isolation fell into a depression, even resulting in suicidal thoughts. "The act of building gave us a purpose, making us feel significantly better. We wanted to be more in nature. We could even live in a treehouse", Filip says. "We just started building, and never stopped. No matter the weather, we continued. I've built treehouses before, but they've never been as good as this one." Mike enthousiastically adds. "We're very proud of it, and I would love to camp here more often".*

*Friend group
Their accommodation regularly offered a place for a friend group of eight. "We weren't able to go anywhere else. This was a nice place where we could still meet.", Filip says. "We had never considered that this was not allowed. This field has been abandoned for many years, so we weren't bothering anyone. According to the law enforcement, this area is an area of landscaping and archaeological importance. But we don't even touch the ground, so we aren't damaging anything."
At the entrance of the field a bench has been placed earlier. The treehouse itself accommodates a marble race, a canopy against the rain, signs warning you that you're under 'camera surveillance'. A self-made bridge connects the construction to a second platform. It costs a climb to get into, but then you also enter an accommodation which offers a view of the surrounding greenery at the edge of the village. An accommodation the two will soon miss. Yet, they don't allow the loss of morale. Filip: "We're just going to search for a place where we can build an even better hut."*

*"The act of construction gave us a purpose. Because of it, we felt significantly better." Filip*

We were royally screwed over... That's all I know. I quickly got back to the editorial to see if I can reverse this:

Me:
*Hey, I saw that the article was publicized despite our wishes. What happened with me asking you to wait until it's all blown over?*

Him:
*Hey, I didn't understand that I was supposed to wait with the article until it was all blown over. It was my intention to receive a reaction from the inheritors. Sorry for the misunderstanding.*

The clock continued ticking...

# 3.6 What just happened

## 23.09.22

Now it happens to be, that the sidejob I've been doing for the past 4 years, is delivering newspapers. The routine of this sidejob is simple:
1. Wake up at 4:35 am
2. Leave the house at 4:50 am by my bike.
3. Arrive at the central depot of my town to pick up the newspapers at 5:00 am
4. Leave the depot and follow my newspaper route.
5. Be home by 6:25 am.
Despite the problem of having to wake up early, I am quite happy with this job. It's just relaxing, gives me some much-needed structure and has made me go from not-so-fit to super fit.

September 23rd 2022, was no different. I woke up at 4:35am, left the house by 4:50, then went to my depot. But, this online article, made me wonder: Do these digital articles get published in the real newspaper?

So, when I arrived at my depot, I asked exactly that to the guy handing out the newspapers. He said: "Of course!". He picked up a *Limburger*, pointed towards a picture on the front page and asked: "Is this you?".

I couldn't believe it. I looked again, and yes, that was indeed me and my friend. In the biggest newspaper of my region (3/4th of all physical newspapers delivered are Limburgers).

Suffice to say, my brain froze for a good minute or two, and I still get chills thinking back to that moment. I had clearly told the editorial twice to delete it, but the fact it was on the front page changes everything. In hindsight what probably had happened, is that the editorial has some kind of rule that they must either publish a story within a set amount of time, or drop it. Them feeling sympathy for us, made them do the bullish thing of publishing our story in order to hopefully change things.

After making a picture and sharing the news with my friends, I thought: The people reading my newspapers will in all likelihood not know that it's their deliverer on the front page. Wouldn't it be funny if I did let them know? All I'd have to do is get a marker from home and write it. To spare myself some efforts I decided to write the shortest text possible which conveys this message, translating to "your deliverer".

Then I thought, hm, it is a bit bullish to vandalize newspapers I deliver. But, this event, it will never ever happen again in my life. So, I will regret it if I don't do it. Suffice to say after packing my newspapers I stopped by my home to pick up a marker.

*Text on our image: Not just a treehouse, but it has to be demolished*

... and people loved it. The article, my small extra touch with a marker. The support was almost overwhelming. To give you an idea:
- The next morning one of the houses I delivered to (and saw the 'your deliverer' note), had cut out the picture of the article and taped it on their front door. Under it they put a text: "I hope your treehouse may stay!"
- Another person I delivered to, happened to also be a lady my mom knows. They had talked about the article and the lady said: "It's outrageous that the municipality does this! I will call them and tell them this is bullshit!"
- When I walked around with my Christmas cards a couple months later (and make small talk + receive tips), at LEAST 10 people had asked about an update of the whole situation. All of them said they found it stupid how the municipality was acting.
- The mom of one of the children I know because I volunteer at a scouting, had seen the article and bought me and Mike (who also volunteers there) a small canvas with the picture of the front page article on it.

- A ton of messages from random people who I barely know who had seen the article, voicing their support.

The article itself was no different. It was 100% on our side, even giving arguments of why this is ridiculous which we hadn't thought of. Now, as for the article itself:

Tag: Law enforcerment
Title: Two friends from Vaesrade have to demolish 'therapeutic' treehouse
Subtitle: A treehouse two adolescents made in Vaesrade has to be demolished again. Causing great sorrow for these friends, who found a lot of support in it.
Author: Geertjan Claessens*

*Once upon a time, there were two friends who were bored to death during covid. This was the case until they found a wonderful tree to build a treehouse in, where, despite all measures, they could chill in.
This is no fable, and the story knows no happy end. When the law enforcement got a hold of the treehouse located in Vaesrade, Mike (21) from Vaesrade and Filip (20) from Hoensbroek have to demolish their construction, because they are in conflict with the rules. The two, according to them, aren't bothering anyone, and would love to stay in the nature. But, like Willem Elsschot had written more than a century ago: 'Between dream and deed, there are laws and practical problems in the way'.*

*Isolation
Which rules the two are breaking is unclear. That being said, Beekdaelen (the municipality) does say to be aware of the situation, and to have an ongoing dialogue with everyone who is involved. In the meantime, the pieces of wood which Mike and Filip want to expand their accommodation with, lay without a purpose in the field under the ginormous tree.
The two students started almost two years ago with their project. The act of building helped them with their isolation. On top of that, they could handle their problems better. Mike struggled, after he had overcome cancer, with chronic fatigue. Filip struggled with performance anxiety and in part thanks to the covid-isolation fell into a depression, even resulting in suicidal thoughts. "The act of building gave us a purpose, making us feel significantly better. We wanted to be more in nature. We could even live in a treehouse", Filip says. "We just started building, and never stopped. No matter the weather, we continued. I've built treehouses before, but they've never been as good as this one." Mike enthousiastically adds. "We're very proud of it, and I would love to camp here more often".*

*Friend group
Their accommodation regularly offered a place for a friend group of eight. "We weren't able to go anywhere else. This was a nice place where we could still meet.", Filip says. "We had never considered that this was not allowed. This field has been abandoned for many years, so we weren't bothering anyone. According to the law enforcement, this area is an area of landscaping and archaeological importance. But we don't even touch the ground, so we aren't damaging anything."
At the entrance of the field a bench has been placed earlier. The treehouse itself accommodates a marble race, a canopy against the rain, signs warning you that you're under 'camera surveillance'. A self-made bridge connects the construction to a second platform. It costs a climb to get into, but then you also enter an accommodation which offers a view of the surrounding greenery at the edge of the village. An accommodation the two will soon miss. Yet, they don't allow the loss of morale. Filip: "We're just going to search for a place where we can build an even better hut."*

*"The act of construction gave us a purpose. Because of it, we felt significantly better." Filip*

Of course, when I got home the first thing I did was message the owner with what just had happened. I sent the following text:

*Dear ███
Things got a little out of hand with the editorial. The time line is as follows:
First, I was in contact with them (the *Limburger*), shared my story and they took a couple of pictures.
Then, I called you, and you stated that you do not feel comfortable with this.
So, I made this very clear to the editorial, and added that we should talk again after the 1st of November (as you indicated).
The editorial ignored this request and now we're on the front page of the Limburger....
The article does not state anything about you, nor does it mention your name. The article is merely about the treehouse, me and Mike.
I am once again sorry for how this went... This really was not my intention.
If you wish to discuss this, please call me, because in the end it is my fault.
But, considering this is now in the physical newspaper, there is little we can change.
Yours kindly,
Filip*

His reaction was succinct:
*I am not happy with this... I am expecting that an arrangement = an arrangement. The cleanup will take place urgently.
The article is at the same time in the* Telegraph.

Finally, my reply:
*"Once again, I am sorry. Of course the clean-up will be carried on.*

For the record, the telegraph is a national newspaper (instead of a regional one). We even got our article published there, but, we didn't make it to the front page.

## 24.09.22

In the newspaper the day after, we also got a brief mention on the pages which reflect on the front page articles of the previous days. This final text reads as follows:

*"Title: treehouse
Who hasn't built a treehouse as a child, or at least dreamt of it. How nice would it be to live in a tree, literally close to nature. But in the end we live a life where rules are considered more important than dreams. Where, as a matter of fact you need to request a construction permit to build a treehouse, or at least proof that it complies with the rules surrounding safety, zoning laws, and what not. The formal form bureaucracy is very frustrating for two people who in 'Beekdaelen we build together' (slogan of municipality) find a lot of support in their treehouse."*

*"Title: treehouse 2
There has to be something to resolve this issue, one would say. To move to dreamland? Or create a free place where everyone is allowed to pursue their dreams? But perhaps we can stay closer to reality. Maybe there is someone out there, thinking: "I know a plot of land with a tree where one is allowed to build a treehouse. If so, let us know through the following mail address. Then we can possibly make at least two people happy. ██@██"*

At some later date I made the following frame to forever honour this event. Of course the wood and plastic I used all originate from leftover construction materials from the treehouse:
